# MachineLearningClassificationOfCognitiveWorkload
Code written for my 2020 senior design project for the Electrical and Computer Engineering Departments at Purdue University Northwest. 

Project Title: Real-Time Prediction of Cognitive Workload Using Machine Learning Analysis of Physiological Data. 

Teammate (worked on the hardware): Brendan James Rathbone-Desch. 

Advisor: Dr. Colin Elkin

Data is from this study: Healey JA, Picard RW. Detecting stress during real-world driving tasks using physiological sensors. IEEE Transactions in Intelligent Transportation Systems  6(2):156-166 (June 2005).
Used to train our decision tree classifier.
